(IOS RemoteCaps)\r\n* If we want the Music Controls to work, we lose the progress bar. (Android RemoteCaps).\r\n* Remotely launch Pebble Apps.\r\n* A lot of things.. still a WIP.\r\n\r\nYou may see some random Toast Notifications about the SocketActivityTriggerDetails (was testing any posibility to get this thing to work).","google":"UA-70412776-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
